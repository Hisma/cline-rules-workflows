# Current Requirements & Focus

## Current Sprint/Milestone
**Documentation Repository Setup & Template Creation** - Establishing comprehensive Cline rules documentation with proper structure, accurate information, and reusable templates.

## Priority Features
1. **Accurate Rules vs Workflows Documentation**
   - Description: Clear distinction between Cline rules and workflows with correct directory structures
   - Acceptance Criteria: All paths and examples match actual Cline implementation
   - Technical Notes: Must reflect the correct `.clinerules/workflows/` structure discovered through research

2. **Research-Driven Content Creation**
   - Description: All documentation backed by verified sources using MCP tools
   - Acceptance Criteria: Every technical claim verified through Brave Search and Puppeteer
   - Technical Notes: Document research methodology and maintain source citations

3. **Reusable Project Templates**
   - Description: Create templates for different project types (web-app, documentation, etc.)
   - Acceptance Criteria: Templates can be easily copied and customized for new projects
   - Technical Notes: Organized in `my-project-templates/` with clear naming conventions

## Current Technical Debt
- Verify all existing documentation against current Cline implementation
- Ensure consistency across all template files
- Add proper cross-references between related documentation
- Validate all external links and references

## Immediate Blockers
- None currently identified
- Research methodology established with working MCP integrations
- Template structure defined and being implemented

## Code Quality Focus Areas
- **Markdown Consistency**: Standardized formatting across all files
- **Content Accuracy**: All technical information verified through research
- **Template Completeness**: Each template includes all necessary sections
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Internal links work correctly

## Performance Targets
- **Research Efficiency**: Complete fact-checking within reasonable time using MCP tools
- **Content Accessibility**: Clear, scannable documentation structure
- **Template Usability**: New projects can be set up in under 10 minutes using templates
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly accuracy reviews and updates

## Security Considerations
- **Source Verification**: Only use authoritative sources for technical information
- **Link Safety**: Verify all external links before inclusion
- **Content Integrity**: Maintain version control for all documentation changes
- **Attribution**: Proper citation of all sources and references

## User Experience Priorities
- **Clear Navigation**: Logical document organization and cross-references
- **Actionable Content**: Step-by-step instructions that actually work
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address common use cases and edge cases
- **Beginner Friendly**: Accessible to users new to Cline

## Integration Work
- **MCP Server Integration**: Brave Search and Puppeteer for research workflows
- **Template System**: Standardized project setup templates
- **Documentation Validation**: Automated checking of content accuracy
- **Community Feedback**: Issue tracking and pull request workflows

## Testing Requirements
- **Content Verification**: All instructions tested in real environments
- **Template Validation**: Each template tested with actual project setup
- **Link Checking**: Regular verification of all external references
- **User Testing**: Community feedback on documentation clarity

## Documentation Updates
- **Setup Guides**: Complete step-by-step instructions for all scenarios
- **Template Documentation**: Clear explanation of how to use each template
- **Research Methodology**: Document the process for verifying information
- **Contribution Guidelines**: How others can help improve the documentation

## Deployment Considerations
- **Version Control**: All changes tracked in Git with meaningful commit messages
- **Release Process**: Structured approach to major documentation updates
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of all documentation content
- **Distribution**: Easy access to templates and documentation

## Monitoring & Observability
- **Content Accuracy**: Regular fact-checking using research tools
- **User Feedback**: Track issues and suggestions from community
- **Usage Metrics**: Monitor which templates and guides are most used
- **Update Tracking**: Log when content was last verified and updated

## Team Coordination
- **Research Standards**: Consistent methodology for fact-checking
- **Review Process**: Peer review for all major content changes
- **Template Maintenance**: Regular updates to keep templates current
- **Community Engagement**: Responsive to user feedback and contributions

## Upcoming Changes
- **Advanced Workflows**: More sophisticated automation examples
- **Additional Templates**: Templates for more project types
- **Integration Examples**: Real-world usage examples with MCP servers
- **Video Guides**: Supplementary visual documentation

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of technical information that remains current
- **User Adoption**: Number of people using the templates and guides
- **Community Contributions**: Pull requests and issue reports from users
- **Problem Resolution**: Reduction in support questions due to clear documentation

## Notes & Context
- This documentation repository serves as both a reference and a template
- Emphasis on research-driven content creation using modern MCP tools
- Focus on practical, actionable guidance rather than theoretical concepts
- Community-oriented approach with clear contribution pathways
