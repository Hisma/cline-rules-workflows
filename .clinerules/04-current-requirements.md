# Current Requirements & Focus

## Current Sprint/Milestone

**Documentation Alignment & Template Consistency** - Updating all documentation to reflect current template implementations and ensuring consistency between educational content and practical templates.

## Priority Features

1. **README Update**
   - Description: Revise README to properly reflect dual educational + research-driven methodology focus
   - Acceptance Criteria: Clear explanation of how rules/workflows work, template overview, MCP integration guidance
   - Technical Notes: High-level focus with links to detailed documentation, position MCP servers as essential

2. **Documentation Audit**
   - Description: Ensure docs/ folder aligns with current template implementations
   - Acceptance Criteria: All documentation references current template structure, includes MCP integration patterns
   - Technical Notes: Update template paths, add research-driven workflow examples, verify all links work

3. **Template Application**
   - Description: Apply docsite-workspace template to this project as working example
   - Acceptance Criteria: Project uses its own recommended rules and workflows structure
   - Technical Notes: Customize templates for this specific Cline rules and workflows documentation project

## Current Technical Debt

- Missing MCP integration guidance in setup documentation
- Inconsistent terminology between docs and templates
- Some internal links may need verification due to template structure changes

## Immediate Blockers

- None currently identified

## Quality Focus Areas

- **Content Accuracy**: All Cline features and capabilities must be current and verified through MCP research
- **Documentation Completeness**: Cover both basic concepts and advanced research-driven methodologies
- **User Experience**: Clear learning path from basic rules/workflows to advanced template usage
- **Technical Quality**: All template examples must work as documented, links must be current

## Performance Targets

- **Research Efficiency**: Monthly verification of Cline capabilities using MCP tools
- **Content Accessibility**: Documentation readable by developers new to Cline customization
- **Update Frequency**: Templates reviewed quarterly, documentation updated monthly
- **Template Effectiveness**: Users can successfully implement templates without additional support

## Security Considerations

- **Source Verification**: All Cline information verified against official documentation and GitHub repository
- **Link Safety**: External links verified for safety and currency
- **Content Integrity**: All changes tracked in Git with clear commit messages
- **Attribution**: Proper citation of official Cline sources and community contributions

## User Experience Priorities

- **Clear Navigation**: Easy progression from basic concepts to advanced implementations
- **Actionable Content**: Step-by-step instructions with copy-paste commands for template setup
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both global and workspace scoping thoroughly explained
- **Accessibility**: Content accessible to developers with varying Cline experience levels

## Integration Work

- **MCP Server Integration**: Essential for research-driven development, must be positioned as required not optional
- **Documentation Validation**: Regular accuracy checks using Brave Search and Puppeteer
- **Community Feedback**: GitHub issues and discussions for template improvements
- **Template Testing**: Verify templates work with actual Cline implementations

## Testing Requirements

- **Content Verification**: Test all setup instructions and template implementations
- **Link Checking**: Verify all internal and external links work correctly
- **User Testing**: Community feedback on template effectiveness and documentation clarity
- **Template Validation**: Ensure templates work as documented in real Cline environments

## Documentation Updates

- **Getting Started Guide**: Update with current template structure and MCP requirements
- **Rules vs Workflows**: Align examples with current template implementations
- **Setup Guides**: Include MCP integration and current template paths
- **Best Practices**: Add research-driven methodology guidance

## Deployment Considerations

- **Version Control**: Clear commit messages for template and documentation updates
- **Release Process**: Coordinate template updates with documentation changes
- **Backup Strategy**: Git repository serves as primary backup and version control
- **Distribution**: GitHub repository with clear README and navigation

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Content Accuracy**: Monthly reviews using MCP verification workflows
- **User Feedback**: GitHub issues and community discussions
- **Usage Metrics**: Track template adoption and documentation effectiveness
- **Update Tracking**: Changelog maintenance for significant template changes

## Team Coordination

- **Research Standards**: Use MCP tools for all fact-checking and verification
- **Review Process**: Community validation of template effectiveness
- **Content Maintenance**: Regular updates aligned with Cline release cycles
- **Community Engagement**: Encourage contributions and template improvements

## Upcoming Changes

- **Phase 2 Documentation Audit**: Complete review of all docs/ files after README update
- **Template Documentation**: Create detailed guides for template customization
- **Advanced Workflow Examples**: Add more sophisticated MCP integration patterns

## Success Metrics

- **Documentation Accuracy**: All Cline information current and verified
- **Template Adoption**: Users successfully implement provided templates
- **Community Engagement**: Active contributions and feedback on templates
- **Reduced Support Questions**: Clear documentation reduces need for additional help

## Notes & Context

- This project serves as a working example of the docsite-workspace template
- MCP server integration is considered essential for effective Cline usage
- Templates are designed to be customized for specific project needs
- Regular updates ensure alignment with current Cline capabilities
