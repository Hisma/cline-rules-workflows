# Project Overview

## Project Purpose

This is a **Documentation Site Project** - a comprehensive resource for Cline Rules and Workflows. The primary goal is to provide clear, actionable guidance for developers wanting to customize Cline's behavior while maintaining high standards for accuracy and completeness.

## Target Users

- Developers new to Cline seeking implementation guidance for rules and workflows
- Experienced Cline users looking for advanced template patterns and MCP integration
- Teams establishing standards for Cline customization and development workflows
- Community members contributing to the knowledge base and sharing successful patterns

## Key Features

- **Research-Driven Content**: All documentation backed by thorough research using MCP servers
- **MCP Integration**: Leverages Context7, Brave Search, and Puppeteer for fact-checking and current information
- **Structured Templates**: Consistent organization across all documentation and ready-to-use project templates
- **Version Controlled**: All content tracked and maintained in Git
- **Community Focused**: Designed for sharing and collaboration with practical examples

## Success Metrics

- Documentation accuracy and completeness for Cline rules and workflows
- User feedback and adoption of provided templates
- Reduced support questions due to clear setup instructions
- Community contributions and template improvements
- Successful implementation of research-driven development methodology

## Project Context

This documentation repository serves as both a reference for learning Cline rules and workflows and a template collection for implementing them. It emphasizes research-backed content creation using MCP servers and demonstrates advanced development methodologies that every Cline user should adopt.

## Current Phase

**Documentation Alignment** - Updating all documentation to reflect current template implementations and ensuring consistency between educational content and practical templates.

## Team Structure

- **Primary Author**: Lead documentation creator and template maintainer
- **Reviewers**: Cline community members who validate template effectiveness
- **Community**: Contributors who provide feedback, improvements, and new template patterns
- **Template Users**: Developers implementing and customizing the provided templates

## Timeline

- **Ongoing**: Content creation and template updates
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly accuracy and completeness checks using MCP verification workflows
- **Community Feedback**: Continuous incorporation of user suggestions and successful patterns
- **Template Evolution**: Quarterly review and update of templates based on Cline feature updates

## Resources

- Research tools: Context7, Brave Search, Puppeteer for web verification and current information
- Documentation standards: Internal style guide and MCP-driven research methodology
- Version control: Git repository with structured branching for template management
- Collaboration: Issue tracking and pull request workflows for community contributions
- MCP Integration: Essential server configuration for research-driven development

## Notes

- This project uses its own docsite-workspace template as a working example
- All templates are regularly updated to reflect current best practices
- MCP server integration is considered essential for effective Cline usage
- Templates are designed to be customized for specific project needs
