# Documentation Standards Workflow

## Overview

This workflow guides you through creating and maintaining high-quality documentation for your projects. Following these standards ensures that documentation is comprehensive, consistent, and useful for all stakeholders.

## When to Use

- When starting a new project
- When adding new features or components
- When updating existing documentation
- During documentation reviews
- Before releasing software
- When onboarding new team members

## Prerequisites

- Project repository
- Markdown editor or IDE with Markdown support
- Access to project codebase
- Understanding of project architecture and features

## General Documentation Principles

### Clarity and Purpose

- Write documentation for your future self and team members
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Use clear, concise language that avoids unnecessary jargon
- Structure information logically with proper headings and sections
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Audience Awareness

- Consider who will read the documentation (developers, users, stakeholders)
- Provide appropriate level of technical detail for the audience
- Include context that may not be obvious to newcomers
- Use examples and code snippets to illustrate concepts
- Provide links to related resources and dependencies

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Plan Your Documentation

1. **Identify Documentation Needs**:
   - What needs to be documented?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What level of detail is required?
   - What format is most appropriate?

2. **Create Documentation Plan**:
   - List all required documentation types
   - Prioritize based on importance and urgency
   - Assign ownership and deadlines
   - Determine review process

### Step 2: Set Up Documentation Structure

#### Project-Level Documentation

Create these essential files in your repository:

```bash
# Create README.md
cat > README.md << 'EOF'
# Project Name

EOF
```

### Step 4: Document Code

#### Inline Comments

Follow these guidelines for code comments:

- Comment complex business logic and algorithms
- Explain non-obvious decisions and trade-offs
- Document workarounds and their reasons
- Use TODO comments for known technical debt
- Avoid obvious comments that just restate the code

#### Function and Class Documentation

For JavaScript/TypeScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the total price including tax and discounts
 * 
 * @param {number} basePrice - The base price before tax
 * @param {number} taxRate - The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.07 for 7%)
 * @param {number} [discount=0] - Optional discount amount
 * @returns {number} The final price after tax and discount
 * @throws {Error} If basePrice or taxRate is negative
 * 
 * @example
 * // Returns 107 (100 + 7% tax)
 * calculatePrice(100, 0.07);
 * 
 * // Returns 96.3 (100 + 7% tax - 10 discount)
 * calculatePrice(100, 0.07, 10);
 */
function calculatePrice(basePrice, taxRate, discount = 0) {
  if (basePrice < 0 || taxRate < 0) {
    throw new Error('Base price and tax rate must be non-negative');
  }
  
  const priceAfterDiscount = basePrice - discount;
  const finalPrice = priceAfterDiscount * (1 + taxRate);
  
  return finalPrice;
}
```

For Python:

```python
def calculate_price(base_price: float, tax_rate: float, discount: float = 0) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the total price including tax and discounts.
    
    Args:
        base_price: The base price before tax
        tax_rate: The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.07 for 7%)
        discount: Optional discount amount, defaults to 0
        
    Returns:
        The final price after tax and discount
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If base_price or tax_rate is negative
        
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_price(100, 0.07)
        107.0
        
        >>> calculate_price(100, 0.07, 10)
        96.3
    """
    if base_price < 0 or tax_rate < 0:
        raise ValueError("Base price and tax rate must be non-negative")
    
    price_after_discount = base_price - discount
    final_price = price_after_discount * (1 + tax_rate)
    
    return final_price
```

### Step 5: Create User Documentation

```bash
cat > docs/user-guides/getting-started.md << 'EOF'

### Step 6: Implement Documentation Review Process

1. **Self-Review Checklist**:
   - Is the documentation accurate and up-to-date?
   - Is it clear and understandable for the target audience?
   - Are there any spelling or grammar errors?
   - Are all links working?
   - Are code examples correct and functional?
   - Is the formatting consistent?

2. **Peer Review Process**:
   - Submit documentation changes for review
   - Address reviewer feedback
   - Update documentation based on feedback
   - Get final approval

3. **Documentation Testing**:
   - Test installation instructions
   - Verify code examples work as described
   - Check that procedures can be followed successfully
   - Validate screenshots match current UI

### Step 7: Maintain Documentation

#### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- Schedule regular documentation reviews
- Update documentation when code changes
- Remove outdated information
- Fix broken links and references
- Improve based on user feedback

#### Version Control

- Keep documentation in version control with code
- Tag documentation versions with releases
- Maintain documentation branches for different versions
- Archive old documentation appropriately

## Best Practices

### Markdown Standards

- Use consistent heading hierarchy
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Include alt text for images and diagrams
- Use relative links for internal references

### Diagrams and Visuals

- Create architecture diagrams for complex systems
- Use flowcharts for process documentation
- Include screenshots for UI documentation
- Maintain diagrams as code when possible (e.g., PlantUML, Mermaid)
- Ensure diagrams are accessible and clear

### Documentation Platforms

- Choose appropriate tools for different audiences
- Maintain consistency across documentation platforms
- Ensure documentation is searchable and navigable
- Provide feedback mechanisms for users
- Monitor usage and improve popular sections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Documentation Issues

- **Outdated information**: Schedule regular reviews
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Use linting tools
- **Broken links**: Use link checkers
- **Unclear explanations**: Get feedback from new users
- **Missing context**: Include background information

### Documentation Tools

```bash
# Install helpful documentation tools
npm install -g markdownlint-cli
npm install -g markdown-link-check

# Check markdown formatting
markdownlint "**/*.md"

# Check for broken links
markdown-link-check README.md
```

## Success Criteria

### Quality Indicators

- Reduced support tickets for documented features
- Faster onboarding of new team members
- Positive feedback from users and developers
- High documentation usage and engagement
- Successful self-service problem resolution

### Maintenance Health

- Documentation stays current with code changes
- Regular review and update cycles
- Active contribution from team members
- Minimal broken links or outdated information
- Good coverage of features and functionality

## Notes

- Documentation is a continuous process, not a one-time task
- Good documentation saves time in the long run
- Documentation should evolve with the project
- Consider documentation as part of the definition of done
- Allocate time for documentation in project planning

**Remember**: Good documentation is an investment in the future productivity and success of your project and team.
