# Project Setup Workflow

This workflow guides you through setting up a new project with proper structure, configuration, and development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Development environment installed (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Git configured with your credentials
- Code editor/IDE set up
- Understanding of the project type and requirements

## Steps

1. **Project Planning**
   - Define project purpose and scope
   - Choose appropriate technology stack
   - Identify key dependencies and tools
   - Plan directory structure and organization

2. **Initialize Repository**
   - Create new repository (local or remote)
   - Initialize git: `git init`
   - Create initial README.md with project description
   - Set up .gitignore for your technology stack

3. **Set Up Project Structure**
   - Create main directories (src/, docs/, tests/, etc.)
   - Set up configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Create initial entry point files
   - Organize assets and resources directories

4. **Configure Development Environment**
   - Install and configure package manager
   - Set up dependency management
   - Configure build tools and scripts
   - Set up development server if applicable

5. **Set Up Quality Assurance**
   - Configure linting tools (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)
   - Set up code formatting (Prettier, Black, etc.)
   - Configure pre-commit hooks
   - Set up basic testing framework

6. **Create Documentation Structure**
   - Set up README with project overview
   - Create CONTRIBUTING.md for contribution guidelines
   - Set up API documentation structure if applicable
   - Create CHANGELOG.md for tracking changes

7. **Configure CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up basic GitHub Actions or similar
   - Configure automated testing
   - Set up code quality checks
   - Configure deployment pipeline basics

8. **Set Up Cline Rules and Workflows**
   - Create .clinerules/ directory
   - Add project-specific rules files
   - Set up workflows/ directory if needed
   - Configure project-specific development guidelines

9. **Security and Environment Setup**
   - Set up environment variable management
   - Configure security scanning tools
   - Set up dependency vulnerability checking
   - Create security guidelines documentation

10. **Final Setup and Testing**
    - Test build process and development server
    - Verify all tools and scripts work correctly
    - Create initial commit with project structure
    - Tag initial version if applicable

## Success Criteria

- Project builds and runs successfully
- All development tools are configured and working
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- CI/CD pipeline is functional
- Security measures are in place
- Team can start development immediately

## Project Type Specific Steps

### Web Application

- Set up frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular)
- Configure bundler (Webpack, Vite, Parcel)
- Set up CSS preprocessing if needed
- Configure development and production builds

### API/Backend Service

- Set up web framework (Express, FastAPI, Django)
- Configure database connection and migrations
- Set up API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Configure logging and monitoring

### Library/Package

- Set up package configuration (package.json, setup.py)
- Configure build and distribution scripts
- Set up documentation generation
- Configure publishing workflow

### Data Science Project

- Set up Jupyter notebook environment
- Configure data directories and gitignore
- Set up virtual environment with data science libraries
- Create data pipeline structure

### Documentation Project

- Set up static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, Sphinx)
- Configure documentation theme and structure
- Set up content organization
- Configure build and deployment

## Common Configuration Files

### Node.js Projects

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint src/",
    "format": "prettier --write src/"
  }
}
```
### Python Projects

```python
# requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
# List dependencies with versions

# setup.py or pyproject.toml
# Package configuration
```
### Universal Files

```gitignore
# .gitignore
node_modules/
.env
.DS_Store
*.log
dist/
build/
```
## Troubleshooting

### Dependency Installation Issues

- Check Node.js/Python version compatibility
- Clear package manager cache
- Check for conflicting global packages
- Verify network connectivity and registry access

### Build Configuration Problems

- Verify all configuration files are valid
- Check for missing dependencies
- Ensure proper file paths and references
- Test with minimal configuration first

### Development Environment Issues

- Verify all required tools are installed
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure proper permissions on directories
- Test each tool individually

### Git Setup Problems

- Verify Git is installed and configured
- Check SSH keys or authentication setup
- Ensure proper remote repository access
- Test with simple commit and push

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize files logically by feature or type
- Keep configuration files in project root
- Document any non-standard organization

### Documentation

- Write clear, concise README
- Include setup and usage instructions
- Document any special requirements
- Keep documentation up to date

### Version Control

- Make frequent, small commits
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Set up proper branching strategy
- Include all necessary files in repository

### Security

- Never commit sensitive information
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Set up dependency vulnerability scanning
- Follow security best practices for your stack
