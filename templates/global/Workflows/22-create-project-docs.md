# Create Project Documentation Workflow

## Overview

This workflow guides you through creating the core set of project documentation using standardized templates. It focuses specifically on the foundational documents that define a project's purpose, technology, architecture, and requirements.

## When to Use

- When starting a new project
- When formalizing documentation for an existing project
- When updating project documentation after significant changes
- When standardizing documentation across multiple projects
- When onboarding new team members to understand the project

## Prerequisites

- Project planning completed
- Basic understanding of the project goals and scope
- Access to project stakeholders for information gathering

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Prepare for Documentation

**Actions:**
1. Review existing project information and materials
2. Identify key stakeholders for each document type
3. Schedule information gathering sessions if needed
4. Create a documentation directory in your project
5. Set up version control for documentation

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
# Create documentation directory structure
mkdir -p docs/project

# Initialize version control (if not already done)
git add docs/
git commit -m "Initialize project documentation structure"
```

### Step 2: Create Project Overview Document`

**Information to Gather:**
- Project name and description
- Business goals and objectives
- Target users and stakeholders
- Key features and functionality
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Project timeline and milestones

**Actions:**
1. Copy the project overview template to your documentation directory
2. Fill in each section with project-specific information
3. Add any project-specific sections needed
4. Review with project stakeholders
5. Finalize and commit the document

**Example Project Overview Structure:**
```markdown
# Project Overview: [Project Name]

## Purpose and Goals

[Describe the primary purpose of the project and its key goals]

## Target Users

[Identify and describe the primary user groups]

### User Personas

[Create brief personas for key user types]

- Update documentation with each major release
- Assign ownership for each document
- Track documentation issues and improvements
- Gather feedback from documentation users

## Best Practices

### Content Quality

- Be concise and clear in your writing
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include diagrams and visual aids where helpful
- Provide examples to illustrate concepts
- Focus on what readers need to know

### Documentation Structure

- Use consistent formatting and organization
- Follow a logical progression of information
- Use headings and subheadings effectively
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Link related information across documents

## Success Criteria

- All core project documents are complete and accurate
- Documentation is accessible to all team members
- New team members can understand the project from documentation
- Documentation is being maintained and updated
- Team members reference and use the documentation

## Notes

- These documents form the foundation of project documentation
- They should evolve as the project evolves
- Consider these living documents, not one-time deliverables
- Documentation is most valuable when it's kept current
- Invest time in good documentation to save time later

**Remember**: Good project documentation accelerates onboarding, reduces knowledge silos, and helps maintain project continuity through team changes.
