# Update Rules & Workflows

## Overview

This workflow guides you through updating your project's `.clinerules/` files to ensure they remain aligned with your project's current state and needs. As projects evolve, the rules and workflows that were initially set up may become outdated or misaligned with the project's reality.

## When to Use This Workflow

- **Quarterly maintenance** - Regular review to keep rules current
- **After major project changes** - When project scope, tech stack, or architecture has evolved
- **Milestone reviews** - At the end of development phases or releases
- **When rules feel outdated** - If current rules no longer serve the project effectively

## Prerequisites

- Project has existing `.clinerules/` directory with rule and/or workflow files
- MCP servers configured for research and verification (recommended)
- Understanding of current project state and recent changes

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Project Assessment

**Objective**: Understand what has changed in your project since rules were last updated.

**Actions**:

1. **Review project structure** - Has the directory layout or organization changed?
2. **Assess scope changes** - Has the project's purpose, goals, or target users evolved?
3. **Identify new requirements** - What new needs or constraints have emerged?
4. **Note technology changes** - Have you added, removed, or updated frameworks/tools?
5. **Consider team changes** - Has the team structure or collaboration needs changed?

**Questions to Ask**:

- What aspects of the project are different from when rules were last updated?
- Are there new challenges or opportunities that rules should address?
- What pain points have emerged that better rules could solve?

### Step 2: Rules Alignment Review

**Objective**: Update your `.clinerules/` files to reflect current project reality.

**Process**:

1. **Inventory existing rules** - Read through all files in `.clinerules/` and subdirectories
2. **Identify outdated content** - Look for information that no longer matches your project
3. **Update project details** - Ensure all project descriptions, goals, and context are current
4. **Refresh technical information** - Update technology stacks, tools, and architectural details
5. **Align with current priorities** - Update requirements, milestones, and focus areas
6. **Verify team and process information** - Ensure team structure and workflows are accurate

**Common Areas Needing Updates**:

- Project purpose and scope descriptions
- Technology stack and framework versions
- Architecture and system design details
- Current development priorities and requirements
- Team structure and collaboration approaches
- Quality standards and coding practices
- Documentation and communication requirements

### Step 3: Workflow Updates

**Objective**: Ensure workflows in `.clinerules/` match current project needs and processes.

**Process**:

1. **Review all rule and workflow files** - Read through workflows in `.clinerules/` and subdirectories
2. **Update outdated procedures** - Fix any commands, paths, or processes that have changed
3. **Verify tool references** - Ensure all referenced tools and services are still in use
4. **Update examples and code** - Make sure examples reflect current project structure
5. **Check integration points** - Verify workflows align with current development processes

**Common Updates Needed**:

- File paths and directory references
- Command syntax and tool usage
- Environment setup and configuration
- Integration and deployment procedures
- Testing and quality assurance steps
- Communication and collaboration processes

## Documentation

**Record your changes**:

- Update "Last Updated" dates in relevant files
- Note major changes in commit messages
- Consider updating project documentation to reflect rule changes
- Communicate significant changes to team members

## Frequency Recommendations

- **Monthly quick review** - Scan for obvious outdated information
- **Quarterly full review** - Complete assessment and update cycle
- **After major milestones** - Update following significant project changes
- **When pain points emerge** - Address specific issues as they arise

## Notes

- This workflow focuses on alignment, not redesign - keep changes incremental
- Rules should reflect current reality, not aspirational goals
- Consider this maintenance essential for keeping Cline effective over time

Remember: The goal is to keep your project's rules and workflows aligned with your project's current reality, ensuring Cline continues to be helpful as your project evolves.
