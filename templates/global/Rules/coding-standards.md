# Coding Standards

## General Principles

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid deep nesting - prefer early returns and guard clauses
- Write self-documenting code that explains the "why" not just the "what"

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- Prefer longer, clear names over short, cryptic ones
- Use consistent naming patterns within the same codebase
- Follow language-specific conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)

### Code Organization

- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns into different modules/files
- Use consistent file and folder structure
- Keep configuration separate from business logic

### Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful messages
- Use appropriate error handling patterns for the language
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Fail fast when appropriate, but recover gracefully when possible

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use TypeScript when possible for better type safety
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use arrow functions for short, simple functions
- Destructure objects and arrays when it improves readability
- Use template literals for string interpolation

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Prefer list comprehensions for simple transformations
- Use context managers (`with` statements) for resource management
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

### General Web Development

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Write accessible markup with proper ARIA labels
- Optimize for performance (lazy loading, code splitting, etc.)
- Follow responsive design principles
- Validate user input on both client and server side

## Code Review Standards

### Before Submitting

- Test your changes thoroughly
- Run linters and formatters
- Check for console errors or warnings
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Update documentation if needed

### Review Criteria

- Does the code solve the intended problem?
- Is it readable and maintainable?
- Are there any security concerns?
- Does it follow established patterns?
- Is it properly tested?

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing

- Write tests for all business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Integration Testing

- Test critical user workflows end-to-end
- Verify API contracts and data flow
- Test error scenarios and recovery
- Use realistic test data
- Automate where possible

## Performance Considerations

### General Guidelines

- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic improvements over micro-optimizations
- Consider memory usage and garbage collection
- Optimize for the common case
- Monitor performance in production

### Web Performance

- Minimize bundle sizes
- Use efficient loading strategies
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation

- Validate all user input on the server side
- Sanitize data before processing or storage
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS, WSS)
- Implement proper session management
- Log security events for monitoring
- Keep dependencies updated

## Documentation Standards

### Code Comments

- Explain complex business logic and algorithms
- Document non-obvious decisions and trade-offs
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for known technical debt
- Avoid obvious comments that just restate the code

### API Documentation

- Document all public interfaces
- Include usage examples
- Specify input/output formats
- Document error conditions
- Keep documentation current with implementation

This document should be updated regularly based on team feedback and evolving best practices.
