# Documentation Requirements

## General Documentation Principles

### Clarity and Purpose

- Write documentation for your future self and team members
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Use clear, concise language that avoids unnecessary jargon
- Structure information logically with proper headings and sections
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Audience Awareness

- Consider who will read the documentation (developers, users, stakeholders)
- Provide appropriate level of technical detail for the audience
- Include context that may not be obvious to newcomers
- Use examples and code snippets to illustrate concepts
- Provide links to related resources and dependencies

## Code Documentation

### Inline Comments

- Comment complex business logic and algorithms
- Explain non-obvious decisions and trade-offs
- Document workarounds and their reasons
- Use TODO comments for known technical debt
- Avoid obvious comments that just restate the code

### Function and Class Documentation

- Document all public APIs with clear descriptions
- Include parameter types, return values, and exceptions
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
- Document side effects and dependencies
- Explain performance characteristics when relevant

### API Documentation

- Document all endpoints with request/response examples
- Specify required and optional parameters
- Include error codes and their meanings
- Provide authentication and authorization requirements
- Keep examples current with actual implementation

## Project Documentation

### README Files

- **Purpose**: Clear description of what the project does
- **Installation**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **Usage**: Basic usage examples and common scenarios
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and settings
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributors
- **License**: Legal information and usage rights

### Architecture Documentation

- High-level system overview and components
- Data flow diagrams and system interactions
- Technology stack and rationale for choices
- Deployment architecture and environments
- Security considerations and patterns

### Change Documentation

- **Changelog**: User-facing changes organized by version
- **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes and upgrade paths
- **Release Notes**: New features, bug fixes, and improvements
- **Decision Records**: Architectural decisions and their context

## Development Documentation

### Setup and Environment

- Development environment requirements
- Local development setup instructions
- Testing procedures and frameworks
- Build and deployment processes
- Troubleshooting common setup issues

### Coding Standards

- Code style guidelines and formatting rules
- Naming conventions and patterns
- File organization and structure
- Review process and quality gates
- Tool configuration (linters, formatters, etc.)

### Testing Documentation

- Testing strategy and coverage requirements
- How to run different types of tests
- Writing effective test cases
- Mock and fixture usage patterns
- Performance and load testing procedures

## User Documentation

### User Guides

- Getting started tutorials for new users
- Feature documentation with screenshots
- Common workflows and use cases
- Troubleshooting guides and FAQs

## Documentation Maintenance

### Regular Updates

- Review documentation during code reviews
- Update docs when features change or are added
- Remove outdated information promptly
- Validate links and references periodically
- Gather feedback from users and improve accordingly

### Version Control

- Keep documentation in version control with code
- Use meaningful commit messages for doc changes
- Tag documentation versions with releases
- Maintain documentation branches for different versions
- Archive old documentation appropriately

### Quality Standards

- Use consistent formatting and style
- Include proper grammar and spelling
- Validate code examples and snippets
- Test installation and setup instructions
- Ensure screenshots and diagrams are current

## Documentation Tools and Formats

### Markdown Standards

- Use consistent heading hierarchy
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Include alt text for images and diagrams
- Use relative links for internal references

### Diagrams and Visuals

- Create architecture diagrams for complex systems
- Use flowcharts for process documentation
- Include screenshots for UI documentation
- Maintain diagrams as code when possible
- Ensure diagrams are accessible and clear

### Documentation Platforms

- Choose appropriate tools for different audiences
- Maintain consistency across documentation platforms
- Ensure documentation is searchable and navigable
- Provide feedback mechanisms for users
- Monitor usage and improve popular sections

## Collaboration and Review

### Documentation Reviews

- Include documentation in code review process
- Review for accuracy, clarity, and completeness
- Check for consistency with existing documentation
- Validate examples and code snippets
- Ensure proper grammar and formatting

### Team Collaboration

- Establish documentation ownership and responsibilities
- Create templates for common documentation types
- Share knowledge through documentation sessions
- Encourage team members to contribute and improve docs
- Recognize good documentation contributions

### User Feedback

- Provide channels for documentation feedback
- Monitor common support questions for doc gaps
- Conduct user testing on documentation
- Iterate based on user behavior and needs
- Maintain a backlog of documentation improvements

## Success Metrics

### Quality Indicators

- Reduced support tickets for documented features
- Faster onboarding of new team members
- Positive feedback from users and developers
- High documentation usage and engagement
- Successful self-service problem resolution

### Maintenance Health

- Documentation stays current with code changes
- Regular review and update cycles
