# Deploy to Staging Workflow

This workflow guides you through deploying your web application to the staging environment for testing and review.

## Prerequisites
- Current feature/fix is complete and tested locally
- Code has been reviewed and approved
- All tests are passing
- Understanding of your deployment process (see tech stack rules)

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] All code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Linting and formatting checks pass
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in development

### Feature Completeness
- [ ] Feature meets acceptance criteria (see current requirements)
- [ ] Manual testing completed locally
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Loading states implemented

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Staging environment is accessible
- [ ] Database migrations ready (if needed)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Third-party service configurations updated

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Code Preparation
```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git checkout [feature-branch]

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin [feature-branch]

# Run final tests
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### 2. Create Pull Request (if not already done)
- Create PR to staging/main branch
- Include clear description of changes
- Link to relevant issues or tickets
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Request appropriate reviewers

### 3. Merge to Staging Branch
```bash
# Switch to staging branch
git checkout staging

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin staging

# Merge your feature branch
git merge [feature-branch]

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin staging
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- Watch CI/CD pipeline for any failures
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify application starts successfully
- Monitor error tracking tools (Sentry, etc.)

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

**Basic Functionality Check:**
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Authentication works (if applicable)
- [ ] Navigation functions correctly
- [ ] New feature works as expected
- [ ] Existing features still work

**Performance Check:**
- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] API response times normal
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance regressions
- [ ] Database queries performing well

**Integration Check:**
- [ ] Third-party services working
- [ ] Email/SMS notifications working (if applicable)
- [ ] Payment processing working (if applicable)
- [ ] Analytics tracking correctly

## Testing on Staging

### Manual Testing
1. **Happy Path Testing**
   - Test the main user flow for your feature
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
   - Test with different user roles (if applicable)

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with invalid inputs
   - Test with empty states
   - Test with maximum data loads
   - Test error scenarios

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Test on required browsers (see tech stack rules)
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Verify responsive design works

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run end-to-end tests against staging
npm run test:e2e:staging

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance:staging

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y:staging
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are discovered:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous working commit
git checkout staging
git revert [problematic-commit-hash]
git push origin staging
```

### Database Rollback (if needed)
- Run database migration rollback scripts
- Restore from backup if necessary
- Coordinate with team before database changes

## Communication

### Notify Team
- Post in team chat that staging is updated
- Include summary of changes
- Mention any testing needs
- Note any known issues or limitations

### Stakeholder Review
- Notify product owner/stakeholders
- Provide staging URL and test credentials
- Include testing instructions
- Set expectations for feedback timeline

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Deployment Failures
- **Build Failures**: Check build logs, fix compilation errors
- **Test Failures**: Fix failing tests before redeploying
- **Environment Issues**: Verify environment variables and configurations

### Runtime Issues
- **Application Won't Start**: Check server logs, verify dependencies
- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify database credentials and connectivity
- **Third-Party Service Issues**: Check API keys and service status

### Performance Issues
- **Slow Load Times**: Check bundle size, optimize assets
- **Memory Leaks**: Profile application, fix memory issues
- **Database Performance**: Optimize queries, check indexes

## Best Practices

### Before Deployment
- Always test locally first
- Keep deployments small and focused
- Deploy during low-traffic periods when possible
- Have rollback plan ready

### During Deployment
- Monitor deployment process closely
- Be available to address issues quickly
- Communicate with team about deployment status
- Don't deploy on Fridays (unless necessary)

### After Deployment
- Verify functionality immediately
- Monitor error rates and performance
- Gather feedback from stakeholders
- Document any issues or learnings

## Integration with Project Standards

This workflow should align with your project's:
- **Quality standards** (see current requirements)
- **Technical constraints** (see tech stack rules)
- **Team processes** (see project overview)

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Application is running without errors
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Stakeholders can access and test
- [ ] Team is notified and ready for feedback

Remember: Staging is your safety net before production. Take time to test thoroughly and address any issues before moving to production deployment.
